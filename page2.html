        <h2>The Happy Couple</h2>
        <p> To start at the beginning, Matthew Scheid was born on February 6,1997 and raised in Cincinnati with
            his siblings Joe, Grace, and Annie. Together they were raised by their two parents, Dan and Beth Scheid.
            Matt was a shy, quiet, smart, and reserved comedian who rarely smiled. He received a dog, Buddy, at
            Christmas in 2011. From there the family grew.</p>

        <p>Graci Doll was born on Feburary 18, 1998, and raised in Cincinnati with her brother Tony. They too were
            raised by both their parents, Scott and Missy Doll. She then later met her adopted sister Prerna, who
            was a survivor of an acid attack in India and instantly became Graci's best friend. Graci's a stubborn,
            warm, bubbily, driven women. When you first meet her, you instantly feel welcomed.</p>

        <p>Matt attended Madeira for his primary and secondary education, while Graci attended Mount Notre Dame.
            They both then enrolled in the University of Cincinnati in the engineering program. But that's not where
            they met. They met while both were working at Denny McKeown's Bloomin Garden Center on Kenwood Road. Matt
            finally built up the courage to send a direct message to Graci on Facebook to see if she would like to go on
            a date. She was nice enough to say yes to such a shy guy. They instantly hit it off.</p>

        <p> Matt began to try new things and opened up to become the man he is today. He smiles more and has become a
            stronger and more confident person. Graci was a bit naive and high-strung before she
            met Matt. Since then she has changed her view on her own goals and centered them around their relationship.
            Matt helps Graci stay calm in tough situations and keeps her smiling. After dating for almost 3 years, on
            February 8th Matt proposed to Graci at a park overlooking the Cincinnai skyline. She immediately said 'YES!'
            before he could even get on one knee.
        </p>

        <p> Matt and Graci are set to be married on May 13, 2021. The families are thrilled for them!
        </p>
