        <h2>The Happy Couple</h2>
        <p> To start at the beginning, Matthew Scheid was born on Feburary 6,1997 and raised in Cincinnati with
            his siblings Joe, Grace, and Annie. Together they were raised by their two parents, Dan and Beth Scheid.
            Matt was a shy, quiet, smart, and reserved comedian who rarely smiled. He received a dog, Buddy, at
            Christmas in 2011. From there the family grew.</p>

        <p>Graci Doll was born on Feburary 18, 1998, and raised in Cincinnati with her brother Tony. They too were
            raised by both their parents, Scott and Missy Doll. She then later met her adopted sister Prerna, who
            was a survivor of an acid attack in India and instantly became Graci's best friend. Graci's a stubborn,
            warm, bubbily, driven women. Who when you first meet her, you instantly feel welcomed.</p>

        <p>Matt attened Madeira for his primary aand secondary education, while Graci attened Mount Notre Dame.
            They both then attended the University of Cincinnati in the engineering program. But that's not where
            they met. They met while both were working at Bloomington Garden Center on Kenwood Road. When Matt had
            the courage to direct messaged Graci on Facebook to see if she would like to go on a date. She was nice
            enough to say yes to such a shy guy. They instantly hit it off.</p>

        <p> Matt began to try new things and opened up to become the man he is today. He smiles more, and has
            started to become a whole new and better person. From June to Feburary 8, 2020 they were boyfriend and
            girlfriend, when Matt proposed to Graci. She immediately said yes before he could even get on one knee.
            That night the family celebrated for the wedding to come. Graci was a bit naive and high-strung before she
            met Matt. Since then she has changed her view on her own goals and centered them around their relationship.
            Matt helps Graci stay calm in tough situations and keeps her smiling. </p>

        <p> Matt and Graci later told us they set the date for May 13, 2021. After that, the pieces began to fall
            into place.
        </p>
